The password generator's functionality is to generate a password when prompted to follow certain criteria. The criteria include:  
* a specific length
* specific character types, such as uppercase, lowercase, numeric and/or special characters

<br/>

### The following images show what the prompts are in order to generate a password.

* The fist screenshot shows the first prompt when the 'Generate Password' is clicked. It would normally be blank, here I entered a number to continue with the prompt.

This following screenshots show the different confirm boxes that appear. Selecting okay will add that criteria to the password generator.
For this example, I have selected to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters.

![Fourth option is for special characters](/Assets/images/GeneratePassword5.png)

### Once all desired options have been selected, a password will be generated to meet the criteria. This is an example of a generated password:

### If the first prompt is left blank, or if a number less than 8 or greater than 128 is entered, then this will be presented so that the user can re-enter a number.
